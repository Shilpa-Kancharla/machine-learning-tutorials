# Unsupervised Learning Methods

# Cluster Analysis
Find **similar groups** of variables/samples; this can be the final goal of analysis or a preliminary step.
- Hierarchical Clustering: Agglomerative (bottom-up) clustering
- Partition-based Methods: K-means, model-based clustering, spectral clustering
- Self-organizing maps, bi-clustering

# Dimension Reduction
Find **low dimensional representation** of data; this is a very useful tool for **discovering patterns** in the data, and also improving the performance of regression and prediction methods.
- PCA: principal component analysis
- MDS: multi-dimensional scaling
- Sparse PCA, Kernel PCA, ICA, Manifold learning

# Questions to Review

## Homework 2

### Theory 2

I collect a set of data (n = 100 observations) containing a single predictor and a quantitative response. I then fit a linear regression model to the data, as well as a separate cubic regression, i.e., Y = β0 + β1X + β2X2 + β3X3 + ε.

(a) Suppose that the true relationship between X and Y is linear, i.e. Y = β0 + β1X + ε. Consider the training residual sum of squares (RSS) for the linear regression (noticing that MSE = SSE/n in this case), and also the training RSS for the cubic regression. Would we expect one to be lower than the other, would we expect them to be the same, or is there not enough information to tell? Justify your answer.

(b) Answer (a) using test rather than training RSS.

(c) Suppose that the true relationship between X and Y is not linear, but we don’t know how far it is from linear. Consider the training RSS for the linear regression, and also the training RSS for the cubic regression. Would we expect one to be lower than the other, would we expect them to be the same, or is there not enough information to tell? Justify your answer.

(d) Answer (c) using test rather than training RSS.

### Computation 2

This question should be answered using the `Carseats` data set.

(a) Fit a multiple regression model to predict `Sales` using `Price`, `Urban`, and `US`.

(b) Provide an interpretation of each coefficient in the model.

(c) Write out the model in equation form, being careful to handle the qualitative variables properly.

(d) For which of the predictors can you reject the null hypothesis H0 : βj = 0?

(e) On the basis of your response to the previous question, fit a smaller model that only uses the predictors for which there is evidence of association with the outcome.

(f) How well do the models in (a) and (e) fit the data?

(g) Using the model from (e), obtain 95% confidence intervals for the coefficient(s).

(h) Using the leave-one-out cross-validation and 5-fold cross-validation techniques to compare the perfor- mance of models in (a) and (e). What can you tell from (f) and (h)?

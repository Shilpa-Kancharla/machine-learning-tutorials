# Outline of Machine Learning Methods

## Linear Regression

### Linear Regression in Low Dimensions

- Least Squares Regression
- Validation Set Approach
- Cross Validation

### Linear Regression in High Dimensions

- Variable Pre-Selection
- Forward Stepwise Regression
- Ridge Regression
- LASSO Regression
- Principal Components Regression
- Partial Least Squares

## Classification

- Logistic Regression
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classification (KNN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Nonlinear Methods

- Polynomial Regression
- Basis Expansion
- Splines
- Generalized Additive Models

## Tree-Based Methods

- Classification Trees
- Regression Trees
- Bootstrap
- Bagging
- Boosting
- Random Forests

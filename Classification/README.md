# Classification

Regression involves predict a continuous-valued response. Classification involves predicting a categorical response. Classification problems tend to occur even more frequently than regression problems in practice. Just like regression, 

- Classification cannot be performed blindly in high-dimensions **because you will get zero training error but awful test error**.
- Properly estimating the test error is crucial.
- Classical classification approaches can be extended to high-dimensions, which we have seen in regression contexts.

There are many approaches out there for performing classification. These include

- Model-based methods: 
  - Logistic regression
  - LDA
  - QDA
  
- Non-parametric methods: KNN classification

- Margin-based classifiers: support vector machines (SVM)

## High Dimensional Classification 
- Classification using linear regression
- Logistic regression (and penalized logistic regression)
- KNN classification
- LDA & QDA
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

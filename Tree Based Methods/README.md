# Tree Based Methods
Tree based methods can be for classification & regression
- Classification & regression trees
- Bootstrap
- Bagging & boosting
- Random forests

The main steps of tree-based methods are as follows: 
- Stratify (or segment) the predictor space into small and simple regions
- For each observation, determine which segment it belongs to; the stratification of space can be captured by a tree
- Predict the outcome by the mean (regression) or mode (classification) of outcomes in that segment

## Decision Trees
- The **regression tree** gives an over-simplification of the true relationship between variables.
- However, it is very easy to interpret, and has a nice graphical representation: you can easily explain it to a non-statistician, and don't need a computer (or even a calculator) to get an estimate.
